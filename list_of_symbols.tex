\begin{description}
\item[$\omega$]{Angular acceleration}
\item[$\Phi$]{Quantum mechanical wave function.  A wave function in quantum physics is a mathematical description of the quantum state of an isolated quantum system. The wave function is a complex-valued probability amplitude, and the probabilities for the possible results of measurements made on the system can be derived from it.}
\item[\emph{Impulse}]{In classical mechanics, impulse (symbolized by $J$ or Imp) is the integral of a force, $F$, over the time interval, $t$, for which it acts.}
